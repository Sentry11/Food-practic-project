# Food-practic-project

During the training, a project was created in which theoretical knowledge was applied in practice.   
<b>Was used:</b>
<li>Fetch function
<li>Promises
<li>Regex
<li>Locale storage<br/><br/>
<b>Applied modularity</b><br/><br/>
<b> Also I imitate a request to the server for a general understanding of the mechanism of this work<b/><br/><br/>
<b>Bebel and webpack are used to visually demonstrate their work.<br/><br/> And I implemented support for older browsers <b/><br/>
